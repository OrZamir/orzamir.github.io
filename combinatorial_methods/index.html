  <h1>TAU CS 0368-424:  Combinatorial Methods in Algorithms</h1>

  <hr>

  <p>In this class we will survey topics from discrete mathematics and graph theory, and their applications to the design of algorithms (and adjacent fields in theoretical computer science). 
    Moreover, we will discuss algorithms solving problems from the world of combinatorics and graph theory.
    Among the topics we will cover are extremal graph theory, sampling and sparsifications of graphs, the graph regularity lemma, expander graphs, and others.
    We will apply these tools to solve algorithmic problems in various settings, including graph algorithms, sublinear time algorithms, conditional lower bounds, and more.   
  </p>

  This course is intended for both graduate students and advanced undergraduate students. The grade components are a final exam (80%), summarizing a class (10%), and class participation (10%).
